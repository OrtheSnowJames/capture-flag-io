## Basic Mechanics

### Teams
Players are automatically assigned to either red or blue team to maintain balance. Your team color is displayed with your name and shows your player's color.

### Map
- The playing field contains obstacles, team areas, and flags
- You may only be able to enter certain areas based on your team
- Some maps have special features like dash pads or team-specific areas

### Collision
- Players can eliminate opponents by touching them
- When you eliminate an opponent, you gain their score (or 1 point if they have no score)
- You cannot eliminate teammates
- You cannot move through walls or outside the play area

### Flags
- Each team has a flag located at their base
- Your objective is to capture the enemy flag and return it to your base
- **To capture**: Touch the enemy flag, then return to your team's flag
- **Flag return**: Touch (kill) the enemy with the flag to return the flag
- **Scoring**: Successfully returning the enemy flag to your base scores a point

### Dash Mechanic
- Press **Spacebar** to dash (move faster for a short period)
- After using dash, there's a cooldown period before you can use it again
- Dash pads on some maps give continuous speed boosts without cooldown

## Game Flow

### Timer
- Matches have a 5-minute timer
- If scores are tied when time runs out, the game enters overtime
- Overtime continues until one team scores

### Intermission
- Between matches, there's a voting period for the next map
- Only the winning team can vote on the next map
- The map with the most votes gets selected

## UI Elements

### Score Display
Your score and team are displayed above your character: `PlayerName (Score, Team)`

### Message Box
Located in the top-left corner, shows recent chat messages and system announcements

### Timer
Displayed at the top of the screen, shows remaining match time
