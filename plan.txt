The plan for maps is to have 5 minutes for each map. The winning team will be shown, but only the player with the most score will be able to choose the next map.
You're thinking, "But then the winning team will mean nothing!" Yeah, that's true. But it also makes the game more skill-based, which is one of the main focuses of this game.
